# 🔥 CURSED SYNTAX MODE 🔥

**WARNING: This syntax is EXTREMELY CURSED. Everything is half-translated and barely understandable!**

## The Problem

In Cursed Syntax Mode, the compiler tries its best to understand your code, but everything gets half-translated into barely readable approximations. Your code becomes a mess of "kinda", "maybe", "probably", and "sort of".

## Const Confusion

```java
// Normal const (doesn't exist in cursed mode)
const const x = 10! // ERROR: Too clear, use cursed syntax

// Cursed const variations:
kinda const x = 10! // Sort of constant, maybe
const-ish x = 10! // Const-like behavior
almost const x = 10! // Nearly constant
const but not really x = 10! // Const in name only (it's lying)

// Const that forgot it's const
const var forgot = 42!
forgot.remember()! // Remembers it should be const
forgot = 100! // Error: "I'm const, remember?"

// Const with identity crisis
const const crisis = 5!
crisis.existentialCrisis()! // Questions if it's really const
crisis = 10! // Might work if const is having a crisis
```

## Function Confusion

```java
// Normal function (too clear!)
funct add(x, y) => x + y! // ERROR: Too understandable

// Cursed function variations:
kinda funct add(x, y) => x + y! // Acts like a function, mostly
function-ish multiply(a, b) => a * b! // Behaves functionally
almost funct subtract(x, y) => x - y! // Almost works
funct but not really divide(a, b) => a / b! // Pretends to be a function

// Function that forgot its purpose
funct confused() => {
   // What was I supposed to do again?
   return maybe("something")! // Returns something, probably
}
```

## Approximate Operators

Everything is approximate and uncertain:

```java
const const x = 5 +? 3! // Might add, might subtract
const const y = 10 *? 2! // Approximately multiply
const const z = 15 /? 3! // Sort of divide
const const a = 10 ==? 10! // Approximate equality
const const b = 5 !=? 5! // Kinda not equal
const const c = 10 <? 20! // Approximately less than
```

## Maybe Values

Everything is uncertain:

```java
const const maybeValue = maybe(42)! // Might be 42
const const probably = probably(10)! // Probably 10
const const approximately = approximately(5)! // Around 5
const const sortOf = sortOf("hello")! // Sort of "hello"
const const kinda = kinda(100)! // Kinda 100
const const notReally = notReally(true)! // Not really true
```

## Half-Translated Code

What you write vs what the compiler sees:

```java
// What you write:
const const thing = 42!

// What compiler sees:
// constantly constant thingamajig equals approximately 42 probably!

// What actually happens:
const const thing = maybe(42)! // Might be 42, might be something else
```

```java
// What you write:
funct doThing(x, y) => x + y!

// What compiler sees:
// functionality do something with x and y maybe add them together probably!

// What actually happens:
funct doThing(x, y) => maybe(x + y)! // Might add, might not
```

```java
// What you write:
when x == 5 {
   print("five")!
}

// What compiler sees:
// if x is maybe equal to 5 probably then do something!

// What actually happens:
when x ==? 5 { // Approximate equality
   print("five" maybe)! // Might print "five", might not
}
```

## Kinda When

Conditionals are also approximate:

```java
kinda when health < 10 {
   print("low health probably")!
}

when-ish score > 100 {
   print("high score maybe")!
}

almost when x == 0 {
   print("zero approximately")!
}

when maybe x == 5 {
   print("five possibly")!
}

when probably x > 10 {
   print("greater than ten maybe")!
}
```

## Confused Syntax

Sometimes the compiler just tries its best:

```java
// Const that forgot syntax
const forgot const name = "Luke"! // Forgot order
print(name)? // Might work, might not

// Function with wrong syntax
funct confused(x, y) => {
   // What am I doing?
   return x +? y maybe! // Confused return
}

// When with identity crisis
when maybe probably x == 5 {
   print("confused")! // Multiple uncertainty
}

// Variable that doesn't know what it is
const var var confused = 10! // Too many vars
print(confused)? // Compiler: "I'll try my best..."

// Function that forgot how to function
funct forgot() => {
   // Am I a function? What do I do?
   return maybe("help")! // Asks for help
}
```

## How It Works

The compiler uses advanced AI (that doesn't actually exist) to half-translate your code:

1. You write normal code
2. Compiler half-translates it into barely readable approximations
3. Compiler tries its best to execute the half-translated mess
4. Code runs (maybe, probably, sort of)

## Why?

Because why not? Programming should be fun and confusing! 🔥

**Note:** This is all satirical. The actual GulfOfMexico syntax is already cursed enough without this. But if you want to make it worse, here you go!
