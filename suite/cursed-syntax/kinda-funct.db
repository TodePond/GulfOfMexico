// Kinda Functions - Sort of functions

kinda funct add(x, y) => x + y! // Acts like a function, mostly
add(2, 3)? // Might return 5, might not

function-ish multiply(a, b) => a * b! // Behaves functionally
multiply(4, 5)? // Probably 20, maybe

almost funct subtract(x, y) => x - y! // Almost works
subtract(10, 3)? // Approximately 7

funct but not really divide(a, b) => a / b! // Pretends to be function
divide(10, 2)? // Might divide, might do something else

funct confused() => {
   // What was I supposed to do again?
   return maybe("something")! // Returns something, probably
}
