// Kinda Const - Sort of constant, maybe

kinda const name = "Luke"! // Might be const
name = "Lu"! // Might work, might not

const-ish value = 10! // Const-like
value = 20! // Behaves like const, but not really

almost const data = [1, 2, 3]! // Nearly constant
data.push(4)! // Might work if you ask nicely

const but not really x = 5! // Const in name only
x = 10! // Definitely works (it's lying about being const)
