// Confused Syntax - Compiler tries its best

// Const that forgot syntax
const forgot const name = "Luke"! // Forgot order
print(name)? // Might work, might not

// Function with wrong syntax
funct confused(x, y) => {
   // What am I doing?
   return x +? y maybe! // Confused return
}

// When with identity crisis
when maybe probably x == 5 {
   print("confused")! // Multiple uncertainty
}

// Variable that doesn't know what it is
const var var confused = 10! // Too many vars
print(confused)? // Compiler: "I'll try my best..."

// Function that forgot how to function
funct forgot() => {
   // Am I a function? What do I do?
   return maybe("help")! // Asks for help
}
