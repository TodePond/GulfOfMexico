// Approximate Operators
// Everything is kinda sort of

const const x = 5 +? 3! // Might add, might subtract
print(x)? // Could be 8, 2, or something else

const const y = 10 *? 2! // Approximately multiply
print(y)? // Probably 20, maybe

const const z = 15 /? 3! // Sort of divide
print(z)? // Approximately 5

const const a = 10 ==? 10! // Approximate equality
print(a)? // Maybe true, maybe false, maybe maybe

const const b = 5 !=? 5! // Kinda not equal
print(b)? // Possibly false, possibly true

const const c = 10 <? 20! // Approximately less than
print(c)? // Probably true, maybe
