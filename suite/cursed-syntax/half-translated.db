// Half-Translated Syntax
// What you write vs what compiler sees

// What you write:
const const thing = 42!

// What compiler sees:
// constantly constant thingamajig equals approximately 42 probably!

// What actually happens:
const const thing = maybe(42)! // Might be 42, might be something else

// What you write:
funct doThing(x, y) => x + y!

// What compiler sees:
// functionality do something with x and y maybe add them together probably!

// What actually happens:
funct doThing(x, y) => maybe(x + y)! // Might add, might not

// What you write:
when x == 5 {
   print("five")!
}

// What compiler sees:
// if x is maybe equal to 5 probably then do something!

// What actually happens:
when x ==? 5 { // Approximate equality
   print("five" maybe)! // Might print "five", might not
}
